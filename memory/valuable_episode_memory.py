"""
Valuable Episode Memory (VEM).

This module stores valuable complete episodes for repetition-based RL.

The stored episode format follows the original implementation:

    (
        episode_num,
        episode_reward,
        states,
        actions,
        rewards,
        next_states,
        dones,
        episode_nums,
        episode_steps,
    )

Both classes below keep the same behaviour as the original LongMemoryBuffer
and LongMemoryBufferTotal, but use clearer naming and cleaner comments.
